        During this talk we'll consider a simple order management system
        for some imaginary e-commerce business.

        count: false

        We will consider a user scenario of creating an order, represented by 
        an `Order` model.

        count: false

        Then we'll see how the requirements will grow with time. We'll apply some tactics to further manage complexity.

        - A CRM event is being emitted

        --
        count: false 
        - Order count on the `Product` model is updated

        # .center[Examples - what not to do!]

        ```python
        @login_required
        def order(request):
            if request.method == 'POST':
                form = OrderForm(request.POST)

                if form.is_valid():
                    Order(
                        user=request.user,
                        product=form.cleaned_data['product'],
                        quantity=form.cleaned_data['quantity'],
                    )
                    order.save()
                    
                    # ... send confirmation email here
                    # ... send CRM event here

                    product.orders_count += 1
                    product.save()
                    return redirect('order_success') 
            else:
                form = OrderForm()

            return render(request, 'order.html', {'form': form})
        ```

        ???
        Why?
        - Mixed concerns - rendering with processing orders
        - No transaction isolation
        - Hard to reuse code for order placement
        - Looks ugly TBH
        - And yet we've only considered a sunny case scenario
        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        # .center[Examples - what not to do - DRF edition]

        ```python
        class OrderViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            queryset = Order.objects.all()
            serializer_class = OrderSerializer
            permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]

            def perform_create(self, serializer):
                serializer.save(user=self.request.user)
                # ... send email
                # ... send crm event

                product.orders_count += 1
                product.save()
        ```

        ???
        Why?
        While not as ugly it still lacks isolation and it's hard to reuse.
        There are some side effects to the serializer.

        # .center[Applying the best practices]
        ## .center[AKA: The good enough solution]
        ### A thin view:

        ```python
        # views.py

        class OrderViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            queryset = Order.objects.all()
            serializer_class = OrderSerializer
            permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
        ```

        ---
        class: light-theme
        ### A serializer:
        
        ```python
        # serializers.py

        class OrderSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Order
                fields = ['product', 'quantity']

            def create(self, validated_data):
                return Order.objects.place_order(
                    user=self.context['request'].user,
                    **validated_data,
                )
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme
        ### A fat model (layer):

        ```python
        # models.py        

        class OrderManager(models.Manger):
            def place_order(self, user, product, quantity):
                order = self.create(
                    user=user,
                    product=product,
                    quantity=quantity,
                )
                
                send_mail(
                    'Order Confirmation',
                    f'... order details ...',
                    [user.email],
                )
            
                send_crm_event('order_created', order)
            
                return order
        ```

        ???
        What did we gain?
        - Separation of concerns
        - Clear definition of the view set
        - Clear definition of a serializer
        - Business logic in the model layer can be reused with ease

                if not wms_order['success']:
                    stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
                    stock.save()

        ???
        - Issues start to pile up
        - Transaction isolation
        - Can return none - needs to be handled downsteram
        - Loads of side effects and updates of unrelated models
        - External API calls - testing is a pain
        - Serializer validation is in fact part of the business logic, 
            because `place_order`, when run on it's own, shoud fail if there's 
            shortage of stock, right? Would mean the reusability starts to go out of the window.
        - Actual robust code would take even more space

        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        # .center[When fat models become too fat]

        Let's try to move the logic somwhere else for the time being.

        We'll introduce a `services` package within the app:

        ```
        config/
        orders/
        | migrations/
        | services/
        | | __init__.py
        | | order.py
        | __init__.py
        | admin.py
        | apps.py
        | models.py
        | serializers.py
        | tests.py
        | urls.py
        | views.py
        ```

        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        We copied the code over to services:

        ```python
        # services/order.py
        def place_order(user, product: Product, quantity: int):
            order = Order.objects.create(...)
            stock = Stock.objects.for_product(product)

            wms_order = send_wms_order(
                user.email, order.id, quantity, product.ean
            )

            if not wms_order['success']:
                stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
                stock.save()

                notify_allocation_team(product, stock)
                send_crm_event('order_failed', order)

                order.quantity = 0
                order.save()
                return order

            stock.reserved_quantity += order.quantity
            stock.save()

            send_mail(user.email, 'Your order was placed')
            send_crm_event('order_created', order)
            return order
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme

        While the serializer - unsurprisingly - looks like this:

        ```python
        # serializers.py

        class OrderSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Order
                fields = ['product', 'quantity']

            def validate(attrs):
                stock = Stock.objects.for_product(attrs['product'])

                if not stock:
                    self.fail('out_of_stock')

                stock_available = stock.quantity - stock.reserved_quantity
                
                if stock_available < attrs['quantity']: 
                   self.fail('out_of_stock')

                return attrs

            def create(self, validated_data):
                return place_order(
                    user=self.context['request'].user,
                    **validated_data,
                )
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        # .center[Chopping it all up]

        If we look more closely we may recognize some sub-actions within `place_order` which can similarily be expressed in the language of the business domain.

        Let's see what they are:
        --
        count: false

        One we may refer to as stock reservation:
        
        ```python
        stock = Stock.objects.for_product(product)
        # ...
        stock.reserved_quantity += order.quantity
        stock.save()
        ```

        --
        count: false
        
        While the other we can call stock reconcilliation:
        ```python
        stock = Stock.objects.for_product(product)
        # ...
        stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
        stock.save()
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme

        We will leverage that natural division and refactor to another module within the `services` package.
        Arbitrarily we will put those in the `product` module.

        ```python
        # orders/services/product.py
        def reserve_stock(product: Product, quantity: int) -> Stock:
            stock: Stock = product.stock

            stock.reserved_quantity += quantity
            stock.save()

            return stock


        def reconcilliate_stock(product: Product) -> Stock:
            stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
            stock.save()

            notify_allocation_team(product, stock)
            return stock

        ```
        
        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        The `place_order` function looks like that now: 
    
        ```python
        def place_order(user, product: Product, quantity: int):
            order = Order.objects.create(
                user=user,
                product=product,
                quantity=quantity,
            )

            wms_order = send_wms_order(
                user.email, order.id, quantity, product.ean
            )

            if not wms_order['success']:
                reconcilliate_stock(product)

                send_crm_event('order_failed', order)

                order.quantity = 0
                order.save()
                return order

            reserve_stock(product, quantity)

            send_mail(user.email, 'Your order was placed')
            send_crm_event('order_created', order)

            return order
        ```
        --
        count: false
        
        Marginally better.

        ---
        class: light-theme

        # .center[Fixing the inconvenience]

        We made our models less fat, and code a tiny bit more ordered. It came at a price of how expressive the model was. Can we do better?

        --
        count: false

        Of course! How?


        --
        count: false

        # .center[🥁🥁🥁]

        --
        count: false
        
        ### .center[🚀 Dependency injection to the rescue!]

        --
        count: false

        While at that, we will introduce an architectural boundary separating the models from the business logic.

        ---
        class: light-theme

        We will introduce protocols:
        
        ```python
        # orders/services/protocols.py

        class PlaceOrder(Protocol):
            def __call__(
                self, user: 'User', product: 'Product', quantity: int
            ) -> Union['Order', None]:
                ...


        class ReserveStock(Protocol):
            def __call__(
                self, product: 'Product', quantity: int
            ) -> 'Stock':
                ...


        class ReconcilliateStock(Protocol):
            def __call__(self, product: 'Product') -> 'Stock':
                ...

        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme

        Make the functions implement those:
        
        ```python
        # orders/services/order.py

        @di.implements(interface=PlaceOrder)
        def place_order(user, product: Product, quantity: int):
            order = Order.objects.create(
                user=user,
                product=product,
                quantity=quantity,
            )

            wms_order = send_wms_order(
                user.email, order.id, quantity, product.ean
            )

            if not wms_order['success']:
                reconcilliate_stock(product)

                send_crm_event('order_failed', order)
                return None

            reserve_stock(product, quantity)

            send_mail(user.email, 'Your order was placed')
            send_crm_event('order_created', order)

            return order
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme

        Same goes for product:

        ```python
        # orders/services/product.py

        @di.implements(interface=ReserveStock)
        def reserve_stock(product: Product, quantity: int) -> Stock:
            stock: Stock = product.stock

            stock.reserved_quantity += quantity
            stock.save()

            return stock


        @di.implements(interface=ReconcilliateStock)
        def reconcilliate_stock(product: Product) -> Stock:
            stock: Stock = product.stock
            stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
            stock.save()

            notify_allocation_team(product, stock)
            return stock

        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        Now, all that's left is to inject back on the models:
        
        ```python
        class Product(models.Model):
            ean = models.CharField(max_length=13)
            name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

            def __str__(self):
                return f'{self.name} {self.ean}'

            @di.require_kwargs(service=ReserveStock)
            def reserve(
                self, quantity: int, *, service: ReserveStock
            ) -> 'Stock':
                return service(self, quantity)


            @di.require_kwargs(service=ReconcilliateStock)
            def reconcilliate(
                self, *, service: ReserveStock
            ) -> 'Stock':
                return service(self)
        ```

        ---
        class: light-theme

        ```python
        class Order(models.Model):
            user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
            product = models.ForeignKey(
                'orders.Product', on_delete=models.CASCADE
            )
            quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)

            @classmethod
            @di.require_kwargs(service=PlaceOrder)
            def place(
                cls, 
                user, 
                product: 'Product', 
                quantity: int, 
                *, 
                service: PlaceOrder,
            ):
                return service(user, product, quantity)
        ```

        ---
        class: light-theme
        # .center[Reaping the benefits]

        Let's see how the `place_order` service looks like right now:
        
        ```python
        # orders/services/order.py

        @di.implements(interface=PlaceOrder)
        def place_order(user, product: Product, quantity: int):
            order = Order.objects.create(...)

            wms_order = send_wms_order(
                user.email, order.id, quantity, product.ean
            )

            if not wms_order['success']:
                product.reconcilliate()

                send_crm_event('order_failed', order)
                return None

            product.reserve(quantity)

            send_mail(user.email, 'Your order was placed')
            send_crm_event('order_created', order)

            return order
        ```

        ---
        class: light-theme

        ### Then, the serializer:
        ```python
        # orders/serializer.py

        class OrderSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Order
                fields = ['product', 'quantity']

            def validate(attrs):
                stock = Stock.objects.for_product(attrs['product'])

                if not stock:
                    self.fail('out_of_stock')

                stock_available = stock.quantity - stock.reserved_quantity
                
                if stock_available < attrs['quantity']: 
                   self.fail('out_of_stock')

                return attrs

            def create(self, validated_data):
                return Order.place(
                    user=self.context['request'].user,
                    **validated_data,
                )

        ``` 

        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        # .center[What we've gained so far]

        --
        count: false
        - Made models an entrypoint for all business ops

        --
        count: false
        - Maintained reasonable code split, no more >1k LOC models.py anymore

        --
        count: false
        - Somewhat decoupled business logic from the ORM layer

        ???
        - The service still depends on the ORM layer, but we could easily make it not depend upon it should we need it to
        - The implementations are easily swappable        

        ---
        class: light-theme

        # .center[To the point of reusability]

        All the logic is neatly contained within the service layer. Theoretically that's the point of the "fat models" doctrine.
        
        But if we were to receive orders from a different place than api? 

        Better yet, if our manager came and said that we're expanding our business
        and on top of SIO orders we need to now support MIO orders and we would have to define MIO order reusing our code?

        --
        count: false
        🤔 Can we? 

        --
        count: false
        💥 Dang it! Validation stayed in the serializer so it's not equivalent! Was it all for nothing?

        --
        count: false
        Of course not!

        ---
        class: light-theme

        # .center[Saving the day with exceptions]
        
        ## .center[Other take at validation]
        
        We'll adjust the validation approach slightly and leverage two things:
        
        --
        count: false
        - Custom base exception

        --
        count: false
        - Transaction isolation

        ---
        class: light-theme

        # .center[The domain exception]

        We'll create a custom exception class

        ```python
        # config/errors.py
        import inflection


        class DomainException(Exception):
            @property
            def code(self):
                return inflection.underscore(self.__class__.__name__)
                
        ```

        ---
        class: light-theme

        We'll catch the exception within the endpoint*:

        ```python
        # orders/views.py

        class OrderViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            queryset = Order.objects.all()
            serializer_class = OrderSerializer
            permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]

            @transaction.atomic
            def create(self, *args, **kwargs):
                try:
                    return super(OrderViewSet, self).create(*args, **kwargs)
                except DomainException as e:
                    transaction.set_rollback(True)
                    return Response(
                        {'detail': str(e.code)},
                        status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
                    )

        ```
        
        --
        count:
        <figcaption>*In "real" code we'd use a general mechanism - like DRF's exception handlers</figcaption>

        ---
        class: light-theme

        Let's now define those new exceptions:

        ```python 
        # orders/services/errors.py
        from config.errors import DomainException


        class OutOfStock(DomainException):
            ...


        class InsufficientStock(DomainException):
            ...
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme

        And let's use those in the relevant services:

        ```python
        # orders/services/product.py
        @di.implements(interface=ReserveStock)
        def reserve_stock(product: Product, quantity: int) -> Stock:
            stock = _validate_stock_exists(product) or product.stock

            if (stock.quantity - stock.reserved_quantity) < quantity:
                raise InsufficientStock

            stock.reserved_quantity += quantity
            stock.save()
            return stock


        @di.implements(interface=ReconcilliateStock)
        def reconcilliate_stock(product: Product) -> Stock:
            stock = _validate_stock_exists(product) or product.stock

            stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
            stock.save()

            notify_allocation_team(product, stock)
            return stock


        def _validate_stock_exists(product: Product):
            if not product.stock:
                raise OutOfStock
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        Leaves us with a really thin serializer:
        
        ```python
        class OrderSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Order
                fields = ['product', 'quantity']

            def create(self, validated_data):
                return Order.place(
                    user=self.context['request'].user,
                    **validated_data,
                )
        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme
    
        # .center[What did we gain?]

        ### There are certain benefits to that approach:

        --
        count: false
        - Transactions are great on their own - there's no real reason NOT to use them
        
        --
        count: false
        - Validation and acting upon the data live in close proximity to each other
        
        --
        count: false
        - Errors are expressed in the language of the domain

        --
        count: false
        - Services become reusable and stackable

        --
        count: false
        - To my taste: better readability
        
        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        # .center[What about the 3rd party stuff?]

        --
        count: false

        ### Same drill, really

        --
        count: false
        We can rework it to create a boundary provided by the interface. We can then inject them intead of passing directly to services.
        
        --
        count: false
        This will make our lives easier in the future.

        ---
        class: light-theme
        
        # .center[Where should the dependencies live?]

        While the implementations and 3rd party services used may change, they should be fairly stable as far as business core of the app is concerned.
        We're try to neatly arrange interfaces so that all dependencies may be found and previewed with ease.

        --
        count: false
        This means the place where protocols are defined should rarely be the place we provide the implementation.

        --
        count: false
        This also for the service names we won't go with `Concrete3rdPartyNameClientCall` while definig services.
        We'll focus on the responsibility of the dependency instead.

        --
        count: false
        Let's define the interfaces then.

        ---
        class: light-theme

        # .center[The `common` app]

        What is the most reasonable place to put the interfaces then? It is a package that's stable and preferrably
        one on which the business code will end up depending anyway. We'll go with the `common` app:

        ```
        common/
        | migrations/
        | ports/
        | | __init__.py
        | | crm.py

        | | wms.py
        | __init__.py
        | admin.py
        | apps.py

        ```

                ...

        # common/ports/email.py
        class SendMail(Protocol):

        class SendOrder(Protocol) -> WMSResponse:
            def __call__(
                self, email: str, oid: int, quantity: int, ean: str
            ):
                ...


        class QueryStock(Protocol):
            def __call__(self, ean: str) -> int:

        ```
        ---
        class: light-theme

        # .center[Adapters]
        
        Adapters, on the other hand, we'll place where they're most relevant.
        They will depend on both the interfaces of the common app as well as the models/business code.
        
        --
        count: false
        - The crm event will land in the crm app.
        
        --
        count: false
        - Emails will go in the notifications app.

        --
        count: false
        - WMS client stuff will go in the orders app.

        Let's provide some dummy examples of implementations for reference:

        ```python
        # crm/adapters/crm.py
        @di.implements(interface=SendCrmEvent)
        def _send_event_impl(message: str, obj):
            logger.info(f"Send CRM event {message} for {obj}")

        # notification/adapters/emails.py
        @di.implements(interface=SendMail)
        def _send_mail_impl(email: str, message: str):
            logger.info(f"Send email to {email}, message: {message}")

        # orders/adapters/wms.py
        @di.implements(interface=SendOrder)
        def _send_order_impl(
            email: str, oid: int, quantity: int, ean: str
        ) -> WMSResponse:
            logger.info(f'POST WMS: {email=}, {oid=}, {quantity=}, {ean=}')
            return {'success': True}

        @di.implements(interface=QueryStock)
        def _query_stock_impl(ean: str) -> int:
            logger.info(f'QUERY WMS: {ean=}')
            return 100  # JIT delivery rocks
        ```

        ### Finally, let's plug our new toys in:

        ```python
        # orders/services/product.py      
   
        @di.implements(interface=ReconcilliateStock)
        @di.require_kwargs(query_wms_stock=QueryStock)
        def reconcilliate_stock(
            product: Product, *, query_wms_stock: QueryStock
        ) -> Stock:
            stock = _validate_stock_exists(product) or product.stock

            stock.quantity = query_wms_stock(product.ean)
            stock.save()

            notify_allocation_team(product, stock)
            return stock
        ```

        class: light-theme

        ```python
        @di.implements(interface=PlaceOrder)
        @di.require_kwargs(
            send_mail=SendMail,
            send_wms_order=SendOrder,
            send_crm_event=SendCrmEvent,
        )
        def place_order(...):
            order = Order.objects.create(
                user=user,
                product=product,
                quantity=quantity,
            )

            wms_order = send_wms_order(
                user.email, order.id, quantity, product.ean
            )

            if not wms_order['success']:
                product.reconcilliate()

                send_crm_event('order_failed', order)
                order.quantity = 0
                order.save()
                return order

            product.reserve(quantity)

            send_mail(user.email, 'Your order was placed')
            send_crm_event('order_created', order)
            return order

        - Ease of testing - fixtures can override adapters! 

        --
        count: false
        - Decoupling

        --

        - Complete inversion of dependency

        --
        count: false
        - Clear definition of project-level ports - it's easy to read

        ** Service Layer **

        For organizing the business domain of the app, that's almost* free of any dependencies.
        Additionally, we expressed interactions of the app in terms of the domain language over CRUD style updates.
        Very characteristic of domain driven design.
        <figcaption>We could make it so if we abstracted the ORM layer with an interface. But that's overkill in django.</figcaption>

        count: false
        ** Interfaces, ports and adapters **

        This is thinking that characterizes statically typed languages like Java and C++ more. Ports and adapters are common in hexagonal architectures.
        Making hard divisions between components of the app provides multiple benefits - like for example enabling dependency inversion and injection.

        count: false
        ** Domain Exception **
        
        Here we leveraged transaction isolation and custom exceptions to our advantage.
        Arguably it's much easier to throw an exception and force a rollback when somethings wrong instead of predicting it based on input.

        Mention the universal language of ddd
